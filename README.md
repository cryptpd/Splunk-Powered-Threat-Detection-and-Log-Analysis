# Splunk-Powered-Threat-Detection-and-Log-Analysis

##overview
This project showcases a Splunk-based solution for cybersecurity monitoring, designed to analyze DNS, SSH, HTTP, Zeek, and authentication logs. It includes custom SPL (Search Processing Language) queries to detect threats such as SSH brute-force attacks, unauthorized access, and suspicious web activity, along with Splunk dashboards for visualizing key metrics and anomalies to enhance incident response.

##Features

Log Analysis: Ingests and processes DNS, SSH, HTTP, Zeek, and authentication logs.
Threat Detection: Identifies SSH brute-force attempts, unauthorized access, and suspicious web traffic.
Custom Dashboards: Visualizes critical metrics for real-time incident response.
Scalable Configurations: Includes example Splunk configurations for easy deployment
